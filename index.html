  <h1><strong>Assignment 6</strong></h1>
    <p>I've always wanted to go to 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park" title="The Yellowstone wiki">
    Yellow Stone National Park</a> but because of one reason or the other
        I've not been able to. I have been checking out the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm" title="nps.gov">
        National Park Service site</a> and going over 
        some of the info there to prep myself for the entual trip there.
